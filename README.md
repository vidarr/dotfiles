# dotfiles

My configuration for various programs (vim, i3, ...)

# Installation

Most of the setup is handled by `setup.sh`.
Just call it

```
bash setup.sh
```

from this directory.

# Requirements

`autoswap` requires `wmctrl` to be available (the package is called `wmctrl` under Debian)

# Eclipse

See [eclipse/readme.md](eclipse/readme.md)
